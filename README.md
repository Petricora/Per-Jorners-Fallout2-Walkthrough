A slightly customized version of Per Jorner's excellent Fallout 2 Walkthrough, taken from https://lemmings19.github.io/fallout-2-walkthrough/original_source.html.

My changes were a combination of OCD and playing with HTML/CSS:
- Changes to the font
- Text justification
- Moving style elements from HTML to CSS
- Using more modern HTML conventions
