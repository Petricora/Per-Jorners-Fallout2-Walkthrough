# Per Jorner's (modernized) Fallout 2 Walkthrough

<p>A stylistically modernized copy of the excellent Fallout 2 walkthrough written by Per Jorner. No changes were made to the text itself.
<p>This version also contains a backup of the original work should its source ever be lost.

---

<p>Changes mirror those of my edits to the [Fallout 2 walkthough](https://github.com/Petricora/Per-Jorners-Fallout2-Walkthrough):
  
- Restored the background from the original version.
- Changed the default font.
- Justified the text body (inital reason for this entire endeavor).
- Moved style elements from HTML to CSS.
- Used more modern HTML conventions (e.g. `<b>` -> `<strong>`).
- Reformatted the tables for readability.

No changes were made to the text itself.

> _Let me enlighten you, grasshopper. Fallout 2 is cool because it's a nonlinear, nonclassbased kickass postnuclear computer roleplaying game with a high replayabillity value. Fallout 2 allows you to play your character the way you want. If you want to play a goodie-two-shoes, you can. If you want to play an evil bastard, you can (Yes, you really can hit children in the groin with a sledgehammer). If you want to play a moron who can hardly talk because of his low intelligence, you can._
