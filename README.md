# Per Jorner's (modernized) Fallout 2 Walkthrough

A modernized copy of the excellent Fallout 2 walkthrough written by Per Jorner.<br>
This version also contains a backup of the original work should its source ever be lost.

Changes are a combination of OCD and playing with HTML/CSS:
- Restored the background from the original version.
- Changed the default font.
- Justified the text body (inital reason for this entire endeavor).
- Moved style elements from HTML to CSS.
- Used more modern HTML conventions (e.g. `<b>` -> `<strong>`).
- Reformatted the tables for readability.

No changes were made to the text itself.
