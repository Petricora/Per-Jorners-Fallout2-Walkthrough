# Per Jorner's Fallout 2 Walkthrough

A slightly customized version of Per Jorner's excellent Fallout 2 Walkthrough, taken from https://lemmings19.github.io/fallout-2-walkthrough/.

<br>
My changes were a combination of OCD and playing with HTML/CSS:

- Restored the background from the original version.
- Changed the default font.
- Justified the text body (inital reason for this entire endeavor).
- Moved style elements from HTML to CSS.
- Used more modern HTML conventions (e.g. `<b>` -> `<strong>`).
- Reformatted the tables for readability.

No changes were made to the text itself: updating it to the current (post-unofficial patch) state of the game isn't really necessary.
